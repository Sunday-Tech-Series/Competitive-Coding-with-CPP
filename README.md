## General info
- Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook. There are several organizations who host programming competitions on a regular basis.
- Focus of the webinar is to emphasize on the importance of Competitive Coding. That is:
  1. Practicing it makes you a better coder who learns to solve questions with ease.
  2. Trains our mind to be more focused and think faster.
  3. Improves logic-based thinking.
  4. Inculcate the habit of learning.
  5. Gives an edge in the technical interviews of big companies like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo! etc.

## Contest

We have a small contest planned for you. This will help you practice and implement the learnings from the session. 

The contest will be of 45 mins in which you will have to give solutions for just 3 problems. The contest will be hosted on HackerRank and the link for the same will be shared at the end of the webinar.
> _**Important:** The top rank holders of the leaderboard will be awarded by some exciting prizes!_

The winners will be announced according to the leaderboard, next week _i.e._, 20th June'21 in our next session.
